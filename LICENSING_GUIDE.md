# Licensing Guide

## Current Status

This repository now has a proper LICENSE file with "All Rights Reserved" copyright protection.

## Why was GitHub showing "License: None"?

When a repository doesn't have a LICENSE file, GitHub displays "License: None" to indicate that no explicit licensing terms are provided. This doesn't mean the work is in the public domain - it means the default copyright laws apply, which is actually very restrictive.

## What Changed

- Added a `LICENSE` file with explicit "All Rights Reserved" terms
- GitHub will now recognize this and display appropriate license information
- The licensing terms match the copyright notice already present in your website footer

## Understanding License Options

### All Rights Reserved (Current Choice)
- **Most restrictive**
- Only you can use, modify, or distribute the work
- Others need your explicit permission
- Good for: Personal projects, proprietary code, creative works you want to control

### Common Open Source Alternatives

If you decide to allow others to use your code:

1. **MIT License**
   - Very permissive
   - Allows commercial and private use
   - Only requires attribution

2. **Apache 2.0**
   - Similar to MIT but includes patent protection
   - Good for larger projects

3. **GPL v3**
   - Copyleft license
   - Derivative works must also be open source
   - Good for ensuring code stays open

4. **Creative Commons**
   - Great for creative content, documentation, designs
   - Various levels of restriction available

## How to Change License

To change your license:
1. Replace the `LICENSE` file content with your chosen license text
2. Update any copyright notices in your code
3. Consider the legal implications of changing existing licenses
